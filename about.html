    <h2>About Suzanne, Your Bun Bo Hue</h2>
    <p>I've been cooking my entire life. My mom is a Vietnamese immigrant. She raised two kids while putting herself
      through school, so she was a busy woman. As a kid, I'd sit on the counter and help hand her spices as she prepared
      the evening's meal. It instilled a love of cooking and family in me, and now that I no longer live with my
      parents, cooking my mom's recipes keeps me connected to her. I don't think anything connects people better than
      food does, and I hope that my home recipes bring a little bit of joy into your life.</p>

  <h1>About Bun Bo Bae</h1>
  <p>I started Bun Bo Bae in January 2019. I'm a full time journalist, and this blog is my passion project. I make a little bit of money on it, but it is by no means my main source of income. This means that I am extremely mindful of the brands I work with. If I'm promoting something on the blog, trust that I am giving my honest opinion and vouch for the product.</p>

  <div class="rice">
  <p><b><i>I focus mostly on easy, everyday Vietnamese recipes you might not find in restaurants.</i></b></p>
   <img src="Image/Rice.png">
   <p>While I also have recipes for iconic Vietnamese dishes like Bún bò Huế and Cà Ri Gà, my main goal is to showcase the diverse world of Vietnamese cuisine. You'll find recipes I lean on as a busy student and full time journalist, like Thịt Băm Sốt Cà Chua or Gà Roti.</p>

  <div class="cheesecake">
  <p><b><i>Sometimes You'll See Non-Vietnamese or fusion food.</i></b></p>
  <img src="Image/cheesecake.png">
  <p>I was born and raised in the Chicagoland area so you'll often find Midwestern comfort foods like Turkey Tarragon Pot Pie. I'll sometimes riff on a familiar Asian dish, like with my Crab Rangoon Dip.</p>

  <div class="cookie">
  <p><b><i>All of my recipes include step by step instructions and process shots.</i></b></p>
  <img src="Image/cookie.png">
  <p>While you should follow the times and instructions in my recipes, it's important to use all your senses when cooking, including sight, taste and smell, to know when you are finished with a step.</p>
